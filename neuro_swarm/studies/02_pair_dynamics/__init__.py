Study 02: Pair Dynamics

Two agents finding balance.

Questions to explore:
- How do two agents influence each other?
- What equilibrium states emerge?
- How does distance affect interaction?
- What happens with symmetric vs asymmetric configurations?

Scenarios:
- symmetric: Two identical agents
- pursuer_evader: Different energy/behavior profiles
- opposite_goals: Conflicting internal states
